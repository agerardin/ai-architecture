# orchestration

distributed, reliable work queue with task state management (pending, processing, done, failed, etc.). Here’s how you can implement this:

Key requirements:

Only one worker processes a task at a time.
Tasks can be “claimed” (moved to a processing state).
If a worker fails or times out, the task is rescheduled.
Success/failure events are tracked for orchestration.
Solutions:

Kafka with transactional processing:

Use Kafka for task distribution.
Workers consume tasks, emit “working on it” events.
Use an external store (e.g., Redis, DB) to track task state and timeouts.
On timeout, requeue the task.
Redis Streams or Lists with atomic operations:

Use Redis streams/lists for the queue.
Use BRPOPLPUSH or XREADGROUP for atomic claim.
Move task to a “processing” list/stream.
On success, remove from processing; on timeout, move back to pending.
Task orchestration frameworks:

Use Celery (with Redis or RabbitMQ backend) for distributed task management, retries, and state tracking.
Use Airflow for more complex workflows.
Custom DB-backed queue:

Store tasks in a DB table with status.
Workers atomically claim tasks (e.g., via UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending' LIMIT 1).
Track timeouts and reschedule as needed.
Event-driven orchestration:

Emit events for “task claimed”, “task completed”, “task failed”, “task timeout”.
Use a master or distributed orchestrator to monitor and reschedule.
Summary:

Redis Streams/Lists or Kafka for queueing.
External store for state and timeouts.
Event-driven orchestration for reliability and scaling.
